You’re honest, you stand by what’s right, and for some reason you believed in me even when I didn’t. What I appreciate most is your honesty — the kind that doesn’t sugarcoat, the kind that actually makes a person think. And honestly, that conversation about man of regrets changed something in me. I went back and thought about everything. I had done so many good things this year… but all I remembered were the regrets. That was the moment I decided: Zero regrets. A complete mindset shift — and it started because of you. So here’s to you, for being real, for being steady, and for being the kind of friend who unknowingly helps someone grow. Happy Birthday, Rakshana. Enjoy your day — you earned it.'
